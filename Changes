Revision history for Maypole-Plugin-QuickTable

0.2    Wed  20 July 2005, 01:00
        - added 'fields' argument to tabulate() - it was hard-wired to 
            use display_columns
            - fields defaults to display_columns + related (i.e. db columns plus has_many accessors)
        - added maybe_many_link_views() method

0.11   Fri  10 Jun 2005, 12:40
        - POD fixes
        - changed the location of quicktable_defaults. Now it's 
            simply a Class::Data::Inheritable method on the model

0.1    Thur  9 Jun 2005, 23:00
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
